# Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate developer with experience in building projects across various domains. Here's a bit about my journey:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **weather-app** - A weather application built with C# (.NET Framework), and **zambot-project** - A PHP-based project created for an internal hackathon, which won 3rd prize.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning autonomous driving systems through the CARLA simulator, focusing on integrating AI/ML for advanced driver assistance systems, alongside exploring frameworks like TensorFlow for machine learning projects.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development, music tech, or autonomous driving simulations.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with enhancing my autonomous driving project in CARLA, particularly with sensor integration and lane detection.  
- 💬 Ask me about my experience with building applications in C# and PHP, or my work on AI-driven simulations for autonomous driving.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve explored diverse projects, from cloud storage solutions using the Telegram API to music theory apps, reflecting my dual focus on computer science and music as an undergraduate student!
