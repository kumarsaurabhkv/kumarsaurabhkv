# Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate developer with experience in building projects across various domains. Here's a bit about my journey:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **ProjectX** - A web application focused on simplifying task management with React and Node.js, and **DataAnalyzer** - A Python-based tool for data visualization and insights.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced cloud architecture and diving deeper into machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development, data science, or automation tools.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing backend performance in my **E-CommerceAPI** repo, built with Express.js and MongoDB.  
- 💬 Ask me about my experience with full-stack development or my experiments with algorithmic problem-solving in **CodeChallenges**, a repo where I share my solutions to LeetCode and HackerRank problems.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve contributed to over 10 repositories in the last year, ranging from small utility scripts to large-scale applications!
